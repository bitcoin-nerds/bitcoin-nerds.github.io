A common criticism of the #blockchain/#cryptocurrency space is a lack of wisdom with respect to how humans behave. With that in mind, what are some books for a #cryptosyllabus from outside the traditional areas that you think #TheSpace would benefit from? 1/15

This is my review for Cryptocurrency - A Trader's Handbook by @cryptorangutang This book is intended for a complete, 100% raw, virgin trader and wants to arm them with the right tools for the cryptocurrency market. In summary, it does a hack job. #cryptobookclub
