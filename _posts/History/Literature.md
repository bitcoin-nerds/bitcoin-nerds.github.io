    [Book review: The Truth Machine](https://www.ofnumbers.com/2018/12/03/book-review-the-truth-machine/)

    A friend of mine sent me a copy of The Truth Machine which was published in February 2018. Its co-authors are Michael Casey and Paul Vigna, who also previously co-wrote The Age of Cryptocurrency a‚Ä¶

    Let‚Äôs improve this list with some essentials.

    For devs primarily but a must for your crypto bookshelf. Andres is great and his collaborators are The Who‚Äôs Who of the Crypto community world wide. (edited)

    Mastering Bitcoin [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491954388/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_MhaXBbFQ6EPPM](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491954388/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_MhaXBbFQ6EPPM)

    IMHO.. The Truth Machine is a solid book as well but more for general business folks or non techies. A good balance is required. Another solid book to give your friends or family who are curious about this crypto passion that has kid napped their family member/friend is The Blockchain Revolution.

    Blockchain Revolution: Alex Tapscott Don Tapscott, Jeff Cummings: 0191091263877: Amazon.com: Books [https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Revolution-Technology-Cryptocurrencies-Changing/dp/151135769X](https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Revolution-Technology-Cryptocurrencies-Changing/dp/151135769X)

    The Tapscott‚Äôs are great for the crypto community like Andres is. Reducing friction with the general population by making the complex simple is what they are all about and something I strive for daily.

    Yeah, most books fit somewhere else than the generic bitcoin history books channel

    Like in their channel by topic, or the other servers for more broad info, some of which prolly includes history

    Good point but I wouldn‚Äôt want to have to bounce from server to server or channel to channel to get a list of all good crypto books. We could create a category like Crypto Books then have channels like DLT 101, Crypto Currency, Bitcoin, Developers, etc but to start we just need to curate a list of books that people recommend, once the list is big enough to parse into a category and index, then we move it. What are your thoughts @‚ßâinfominer ?

    Yeah, the bitcoin servers all will get printed to the same site... so that all gets merged

    So... still i consciously overlap, on occasion

    But ideally each bitcoin server is as focused as possible
