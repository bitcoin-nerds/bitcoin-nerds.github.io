    The Alternative History of Public-Key Cryptography

    [https://cryptome.org/ukpk-alt.htm](https://cryptome.org/ukpk-alt.htm)

    Over the past twenty years, Diffie, Hellman and Merkle have become world famous as the cryptographers who invented the concept of public-key cryptography, while Rivest, Shamir and Adleman have been credited with developing RSA, the most beautiful implementation of public-key cryptography. However, a recent announcement means that the history books are having to be rewritten. According to the British Government, public-key cryptography was originally invented at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, the top-secret establishment that was formed from the remnants of Bletchley Park after the Second World War. This is a story of remarkable ingenuity, anonymous heroes and a government cover-up that endured for decades.

    Abstract: This paper is concerned with two aspects of cryptography in which the author has been working. One is the Data Encryption Standard (DES), developed at IBIM and now in wide use for commercial cryptographic applications. This is a ‚Äúprivate key‚Äù system; the communicants share a secret key, and the eavesdropper will succeed if he can guess this key among its quadrillions of possibilities. The other is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, a typical ‚Äúpublic key‚Äù cryptographic system. Its security is based on the difficulty of taking ‚Äúdiscrete logarithms‚Äù (reversing the process of exponentiation in a finite field). We describe the system and some analytic attacks against it.

    **Multiuser cryptographic techniques**

    This paper deals with new problems which arise in the application of cryptography to computer commu- nication systems with large numbers of users. Fore- most among these is the key distribution problem. We suggest two techniques for dealing with this problem. The first employs current technology and requires sub- version of several separate key distribution nodes to compromise the system's security. Its disadvantage is a high overhead for single message connections. The second technique is still in the conceptual phase, but promises to eliminate completely the need for a secure key distribution channel, by making the sender's key- ing information public. It is also shown how such a public key cryptosystem would allow the development of an authentication system which generates an un- forgeable, message dependent digital signature.

    **An Interview with MARTIN HELLMAN**

    Leading cryptography scholar Martin Hellman begins by discussing his developing interest in cryptography, factors underlying his decision to do academic research in this area, and the circumstances and fundamental insights of his invention of public key cryptography with collaborators Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle at Stanford University in the mid-1970s. He also relates his subsequent work in cryptography with Steve Pohlig (the Pohlig-Hellman system) and others. Hellman addresses his involvement with and the broader context of the debate about the federal government‚Äôs cryptography policy‚Äîregarding to the National Security Agency‚Äôs (NSA) early efforts to contain and discourage academic work in the field, the Department of Commerce‚Äôs encryption export restrictions (under the International Traffic of Arms Regulation, or ITAR), and key escrow (the so-called Clipper chip). He also touches on the commercialization of cryptography with RSA Data Security and VeriSign, as well as indicates some important individuals in academe and industry who have not received proper credit for their accomplishments in the field of cryptography.

    The system I called the ax1x2 system in this paper has since become known as Diffie-Hellman key exchange. While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called "Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange" if names are to be associated with it. I hope this small pulpit might help in that endeavor to recognize Merkle's equal contribution to the invention of public key cryptography. Space does not permit an explanation of the quirk of fate that seems to have deprived Merkle of the credit he deserves, but a quirk it is.

    Chapter 9 Competition

    [http://cryptome.org/jya/pp09.htm](http://cryptome.org/jya/pp09.htm)

    What must have come as NSA's biggest blow took place in 1976, when the two anti-DES scientists from Stanford, Hellman and Diffie, came up with what David Kahn called "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance." Later refined by three scientists at MIT, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, the system was labeled public-key cryptography and offered a radical new twist to an old concept. Rather than using the same key, as with the DES, to encrypt and decrypt, the public-key system allows for two separate keys--one limited to encryption and the other to decryption. What this means is that a person can now freely distribute his computer's encryption key, such as in a national directory, permitting anyone to send secret information to him. But only he is able to decrypt the messages, since he alone has the decrypt key. An added bonus of the system is that it also permits the sender of the messages to sign, in effect, in indelible code, thus ensuring the authenticity of the author.

    **NSA Backdoor Key from Lotus-Notes**

    Before the US crypto export regulations were finally disolved the export version of Lotus Notes used to include a key escrow / backdoor feature called differential cryptography. The idea was that they got permission to export 64 bit crypto if 24 of those bits were encrypted for the NSA's public key. The NSA would then only have the small matter of brute-forcing the remaining 40 bits to get the plaintext, and everyone else would get a not-that-great 64 bit key space (which probably already back then NSA would have had the compute power to brute force also, only at higher cost).

    One of the best-known patents in the computer industry is patent Number 4,405,829, "Cryptographic Communications System and Method," the patent on RSA public-key cryptography. This patent, which expires on September 20, 2000, covers every implementation of RSA encryption in the United States. Because the algorithm is patented, it is a violation of US law for a company to write its own implementation of the RSA algorithm and use it without a license from Public Key Partners, the company that has an exclusive license to the patent from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the university where the algorithm was developed. It's even illegal for a public-spirited citizen to write his or her own implementation of RSA and give it away.
