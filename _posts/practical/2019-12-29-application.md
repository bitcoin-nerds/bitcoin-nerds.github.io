* [docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting)
  > Trusted third parties are security holes. By relying on someone else to manage a server for you, you are potentially exposing yourself to a certain attack vector. The most significant attack vector when using a third party host is that a malicious and technically skilled host can create a forked version of BTCPay Server and modify it so that it either spy on your transactions or replace your xpubkey with his. This means that future payments made to you may end up in a malicious party wallet.
  >
  > BTCPay does not allow server hosts to view the stores of other users nor have access to any personal data (except for registration email address). The xpubkey and even balances of other users can't be seen. However, as mentioned, a malicious third party could modify that by creating a fork that can look like BTCPay on the front but be something completely different in reality. The biggest concern, which happens when using a third-party host (even if the owner of a self-hosted server is not malicious) comes from the nature of the Bitcoin itself. If a user is not running a full node but instead relies on someone else's node, his transactions can be listened to by the owner of that node.
