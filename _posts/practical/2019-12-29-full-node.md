  > Bitcoin Core initial synchronization will take time and download a lot of data. You should make sure that you have enough bandwidth and storage for the full block chain size (over 200GB). If you have a good Internet connection, you can help strengthen the network by keeping your PC running with Bitcoin Core and port 8333 open. Read the full node guide for details.

  > While managing your own keys ensures that you can't lose your money due to the negligence or maliciousness of a custodian, running a full node ensures that you can't be tricked into accepting invalid bitcoin payments. Running and using your own node gives you the strongest security model Bitcoin has to offer.

  > There's a common misconception that all full nodes store the entire blockchain. The reality is a bit more complex: (1) A new node downloads the entire chain only to trustlessly compute the current UTXO set: what coins exist and who owns them (also called the chainstate).

### Pi2

(The main limitation for pi2 is 1 gig of ram... and I saw in btcpayserver chat the PI4 is even recommended because of the additional ram. However, if you're not processing a multitude of transactions, perhaps it would suffice to start. It would likely prove necessary to download the blockchain with another device, then copy it to your microsd.)
