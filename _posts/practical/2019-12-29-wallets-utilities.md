## Wallets

> * Do not use wallets that don't give you recovery data; these wallets are likely controlling your keys.
> * Do not use paper wallets unless you're an advanced user who understands all the risks.
> * Do not store large amounts of value in single signature wallets.
> * Make sure your heirs know how to recover your wallets without you!
> Note that it is NOT recommended that novices use the Bitcoin Core wallet. If you want to use a wallet backed by a fully validating node you run, read [Securing Your Financial Sovereignty](https://blog.lopp.net/securing-your-financial-sovereignty/).

  > It is an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum wallet backed by a full node, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed recovery phrases, coin control and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node. Full node wallets are important in bitcoin because they are an big part of what makes the system be trustless. No longer do people have to trust a financial institution like a bank or paypal, they can run software on their own computers. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine. Full node wallets are also important for privacy. Using Electrum under default configuration requires it to send (hashes of) all your bitcoin addresses to some server. That server can then easily spy on your transactions. Full node wallets like Electrum Personal Server would download the entire blockchain and scan it for the user's own addresses, and therefore don't reveal to anyone else which bitcoin addresses they are interested in.

## Utilities

### Escrow

Escrow Agents should be impartial and trusted intermediaries who hold custody of buyer's funds until pre-defined conditions are met. With the help of public key encryption, parties who don't know or trust each-other can engage in commerce, online.
