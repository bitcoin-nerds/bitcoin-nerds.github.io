  >These essays represent varying viewpoints on what Bitcoin is to each participant. The common thread is a long time horizon, deep knowledge on the topic and some historical context. The idea is to provide a contrast to the increasingly short term focus that other platforms and businesses seem to precipitate. I hope you enjoy the series.

* [A Bitcoin Standard: Lessons from the Gold Standard](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bitcoin-standard-lessons.pdf) - Warren E. Weber - October 2015
  > This paper imagines a world in which countries are on the bitcoin standard, mon-etary system in which all media of exchange are or are backed by the cryptocurrencybitcoin. It examines the lessons from the “Classical Gold Standard” period, 1880-1914,for the bitcoin standard. The paper describes the “rules of the game” that countrieson the gold standard were supposed to follow. It shows how gold points permittedcountries to follow interest rate policies, and it argues that monetary authorities couldact as lenders of last resort because of their ability to issue fiduciary currencies. Itfinds that under the gold standard price levels tended to move together and there waslittle inflation over the period studied. It also finds that exchange rates were relativelystable and that there was good real output growth. The paper argues that becausevirtually no transactions costs for international transactions, countries could not followinterest rate policies under the bitcoin standard, although they would still have limitedability to act as lenders of last resort. Based on this experience during the ClassicalGold Standard period, the paper conjectures that there would be mild deflation, lownominal interest rates, fixed exchange rates, and good output growth under the bitcoinstandard.
