  >These essays represent varying viewpoints on what Bitcoin is to each participant. The common thread is a long time horizon, deep knowledge on the topic and some historical context. The idea is to provide a contrast to the increasingly short term focus that other platforms and businesses seem to precipitate. I hope you enjoy the series.

  >Much has been published recently about the awesome promises of electronic commerce and trade on the Internet if only a reliable, secure mechanism for value exchange could be developed. This paper describes the differences between mere encrypted credit card schemes and true digital cash, which presents a revolutionary opportunity to transform payments. The nine key elements of an electronic, digital cash are outlined and a tenth element is proposed which would embody digital cash with a non- political unit of value.

* [A Bitcoin Standard: Lessons from the Gold Standard](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bitcoin-standard-lessons.pdf) - Warren E. Weber - October 2015
  > This paper imagines a world in which countries are on the bitcoin standard, mon-etary system in which all media of exchange are or are backed by the cryptocurrencybitcoin. It examines the lessons from the “Classical Gold Standard” period, 1880-1914,for the bitcoin standard. The paper describes the “rules of the game” that countrieson the gold standard were supposed to follow. It shows how gold points permittedcountries to follow interest rate policies, and it argues that monetary authorities couldact as lenders of last resort because of their ability to issue fiduciary currencies. Itfinds that under the gold standard price levels tended to move together and there waslittle inflation over the period studied. It also finds that exchange rates were relativelystable and that there was good real output growth. The paper argues that becausevirtually no transactions costs for international transactions, countries could not followinterest rate policies under the bitcoin standard, although they would still have limitedability to act as lenders of last resort. Based on this experience during the ClassicalGold Standard period, the paper conjectures that there would be mild deflation, lownominal interest rates, fixed exchange rates, and good output growth under the bitcoinstandard.

## Books

I'm skeptical about most of them, each book has it's pros and cons, while everyone has different filters for skepticism :shrug: Easier to quote, verify, and critique information that's freely available online.

  > "Bitcoin, the landmark digital money and financial technology, has spawned a global social movement with utopian ambitions. The notion of a new currency, maintained by the computers of users around the world, has been the butt of many jokes, but that has not stopped it from growing into a technology worth billions of dollars, supported by the hordes of followers who have come to view it as the most important new idea since the creation of the Internet."

  > Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we’ve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. The Truth Machine reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With the same balanced perspective they brought to The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes―moving humanity forward, not backward.
