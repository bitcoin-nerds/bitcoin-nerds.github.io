  >While [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) is still a great resource, we feel that recent events are damaging Bitcoin.orgâ€™s neutrality. Furthermore, the maintainers and domain owners have, over the past few years, been taking unilateral actions which go against the wishes of and occurred without the consent of the community. These actions have been driving away frequent contributors to the project.
  >
  >As a result of these, we have decided to launch btcinformation.org as a community maintained fork of Bitcoin.org. The goal of this site is to be a neutral, informational resource about Bitcoin and how to use Bitcoin.
  >
  >This website, like Bitcoin.org, is fully open source. If you would like to contribute or view the source code, please visit [achow101/btcinformation.org](https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org)
