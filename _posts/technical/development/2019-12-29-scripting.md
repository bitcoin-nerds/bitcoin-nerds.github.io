* [Bitcoin Covenants](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/MES16.pdf)
  >Abstract.This paper presents an extension to Bitcoinâ€™s script language enabling covenants, a primitive that allows transactions to restrict howthe value they transfer is used in the future. Covenants expand the set offinancial instruments expressible in Bitcoin, and enable new powerful andnovel use cases. We illustrate two novel security constructs built usingcovenants.
* [Yes, Bitcoin Can Do Smart Contracts and Particl Demonstrates How](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/yes-bitcoin-can-do-smart-contracts-and-particl-demonstrates-how/)
  >The Bitcoin blockchain is not known for its ability to enable smart contracts. In fact, most developers creating smart contracts use a different blockchain, like Ethereum. But the truth is that the Bitcoin protocol can be used to create smart contracts. Particl.io, the blockc...
* [Bitcoin Magazine - Scriptless Scripts: How Bitcoin Can Support Smart Contracts](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/scriptless-scripts-how-bitcoin-can-support-smart-contracts-without-smart-contracts/)
  >Bitcoinâ€™s capacity is limited. Meanwhile, smart contracts can be resource intensive. So even though Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contract functionality, the two have never been a natural match.But a recent topic of research spearheaded by Blockstream mathematici...

  > Iâ€™m not suggesting that Russelâ€™s Simplicity toolchain is for securing Unix bootstrap, instead focus is to secure future blockchain script languages. However, it does seem that it too can support Scheme-like script atoms, and lessons from it could be leveraged beyond bl...

  > Interesting, some of these approaches toward "Reduced Binary Seed" make use of minimized Scheme, which is also a potential target for Russel Oâ€™Connorâ€™s of @Blockstreamâ€™s provable Simplicy toolchain, which can maybe probably secure each of the Scheme atoms. [https://t](https://t/)....
