## Digital Privacy

*Not Specific to Bitcoin*

* [Sarah Jamie Lewis (@SarahJamieLewis)](https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1026340294818582533)
  > If you are waiting for a government to give you meaningful privacy from surveillance you are going to be waiting a long time. Privacy is consent. Consent is, unfortunately, something that you sometimes have to enforce.
* [Jameson Lopp (@lopp)](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1026139157125640192)
  > The cost of maintaining one's privacy continues to rise as the cost of surveillance technology continues to fall. Most folks have neither the time nor the money to properly protect their privacy these days. Cypherpunks are the intolerant minority, the Spartans defending th...
* [Payment Systems and Privacy](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2018/07/16/payment-systems-and-privacy)  by Charles Kahn - 2018-07-16
  > Abstract: Privacy in payments is desired not just for illegal transactions, but also for protection from malfeasance or negligence by counterparties or by the payments system provider itself. Proposals to abolish cash take inadequate account of these legitimate demands for privacy. While central banks can play a useful role in setting standards for payments privacy, they are unlikely to have a comparative advantage at providing privacy. Therefore the replacement of cash by central bank electronic money is likely to spur demand for alternative means of payments to solve specific privacy problems.
