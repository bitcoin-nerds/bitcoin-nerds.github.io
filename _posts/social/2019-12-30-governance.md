  > Layer 1 governance is not socially scalable unless we either ruthlessly minimize the number of issues it addresses or sacrifice some of the key properties that give a blockchain value. [https://t.co/C1abR6FXwD](https://t.co/C1abR6FXwD)

  > Was reminded this weekend of one of my favorite charts--from @ChristopherA's blog post. It shows cooperation within a group as size scales, for groups where a) no punishment, b) punishment of defectors, and c) punishment of defectors and non-punishers [https://t.co/09sX7k](https://t.co/09sX7k)...

[Bitcoin Governance – Pierre Rochard – Medium](https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f)
  > Bitcoin’s governance matters because Bitcoin is the first successful, most liquid, and most widely known crypto-currency. In the words of Michael Goldstein, “Sound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.” If Bitcoin’s governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. If Bitcoin’s governance is flawed, Bitcoin’s stakeholders should work to fix it.
