I've built this site as part of my effort to understand Bitcoin, while also learning the [tools of web-workers](https://web-work.tools).

When I first found crypto, I was thinking I might generate an income by writing, and found at the same time, that I could earn cryptocurrencies, by participating in their ecosystems. For the first year, I ate up the marketing ploys of various cryptocurrencies. After considerable study, I became disenchanted, and decided I must learn a lot more about Bitcoin before I could adequately assess these crypto schemes.

While gig-working, I found my services in research based content in great demand from the enterprise space, and some cryptocurrency startups. I wanted to become valuable in the Bitcoin space, and realized I must put a lot more effort into the subject, on my own.

I also realised that creating quality content requires a lot of research. I didn't have enough background knowledge to cover these complex topics in a cost effective fashion. I *can* create quality content, but that takes a lot of time, and there are plenty who could do that work more efficiently, given the proper sources.

I became more interested in the idea of mapping out areas of interest in lists of links organizaed by topic, as a learning technique that also makes the subject more accessible to others, and could be used as the foundation for an endless variety of content. 

These techniques have not yet widely facilitated the work of content creators, besides myself. However, and their application seems nearly limitless, in todays age of exponentially growing information sets.

## Not just Bitcoin History

For complex subjects, I like to go back in history, to when they weren't so complex.  For Bitcoin, I began studying the history of each of its fundamental components. Bitcoin is the intersection of many domains and areas of inquiry, and its histories seem an endless pursuit. 

I also felt it would be valuable to gather together all resources related to practical application of the Bitcoin protocol. While enterprise seeks iterate upon the idea of Bitcoin, this pursuit seems to have blinded many to the beauty of Bitcoin itself. It's not only the first of its kind, but is culmination of the decades old pursuit of digital currency. The cryptocurrency space is currently learning the lessons of a global regulatory environment that Bitcoin was designed specifically in response to.

While I do stay abreast of the cryptocurrency space, and see it as valuable to be educated about, I am a Bitcoiner at heart.
