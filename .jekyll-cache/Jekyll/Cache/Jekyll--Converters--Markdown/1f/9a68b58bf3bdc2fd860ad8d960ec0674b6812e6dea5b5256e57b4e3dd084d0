I"<p>OMG!!!! I just sorted all the links I’ve collected about Bitcoin for the past couple years…</p>

<p>Well, see, I wasn’t just collecting information about Bitcoin… I’ve been studying the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency space, and collecting information about all of it, so my Bitcoin information was largely mixed in with all that stuff.</p>

<p>Primarily my focus has been on Bitcoin History.  So what I wanted was to build a website for Bitcoin History.. but I thought it made sense to organize my links about Bitcoin, first.. so the Bitcoin history could live with the rest of my Bitcoin information.</p>

<p>idk.. this is a bit of a mess, but… it’s a good start, and now I have somewhere to publish histories and other information related to Bitcoin.</p>
