          <p>The insecurity discussion starts near the bottom of page 2 of the paper The security issues the paper discusses are pretty simple to solve theoretically, but they all increase the communication complexity of the signing schemes from O(n^2) to O(n^3) Which means there‚Äôs that many more points at which the multisig can be sabotaged or an error of some sort can occur Which basically means that all of those schemes are useless for large numbers of participants Not that they were that useful for any significant number of participants with a complexity of O(n^2)</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In this talk Pieter went into the benefits of these ideas and discussed an upcoming proposal for a first step that combines a subset of these ideas. Some ideas will be left for future extensions, in order to avoid complexity and limiting the design space. Yet, this would bring privacy and flexibility benefits to Bitcoin, as well as moderate scaling advantages. The main focus is Taproot, which has the potential to make all outputs look identical, by merging pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-scripthash into one - but other changes will be needed to make it widely applicable and efficient.‚Äù</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Over the past year, the prevailing thought among many in the cryptocurrency communities is that bitcoin is not keeping up with other coins. That somehow bitcoin was being intentionally crippled, or that the developers did not know what they were doing. As we are seeing with the bitcoin dominance going up, that prevailing thought was wrong. The coins who were supposedly going to kill bitcoin have been all but abandoned in many cases. Many others are in the process of dying a slow death (which may take years to fully play out).</p>
