    <p>Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment protocol and digital currency based on cryptography. Released to the world in 2009, by pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has proven robust and succeeded where many others have failed.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Bitcoin is a revolutionary system that is quite complex and has a steep learning curve. Make sure you have a decent grasp of the system before you store a significant amount of value in it. If you make a critical mistake such as losing your keys or sending your money to a scammer, no one can fix it!</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>If you’re getting started with Bitcoin, there are a few things you should know. Bitcoin lets you exchange money and transact in a different way than you normally do. As such, you should take time to inform yourself before using Bitcoin for any serious transaction. Bitcoin should be treated with the same care as your regular wallet, or even more in some cases!</p>

          <p>These essays represent varying viewpoints on what Bitcoin is to each participant. The common thread is a long time horizon, deep knowledge on the topic and some historical context. The idea is to provide a contrast to the increasingly short term focus that other platforms and businesses seem to precipitate. I hope you enjoy the series.</p>

It’s because I’m a bad trader and I KNOW I’M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT’S GOING DOWN I’M GONNA SELL he he he and then they’re like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY’RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I’m not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I’m already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU’RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying “OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD” YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.</p>
