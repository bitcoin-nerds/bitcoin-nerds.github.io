    <blockquote>
      <p>The UTXO set is a growing problem. We had a talk this morning about dust in the UTXO talk. We have about 60 million UTXOs. The problem is that as we heard in the talk before, the blockchain is quite an inefficient data structure for UTXOs because if I want to download an old block, I need all the blockheaders in between. If I want to download an old transaction and check if itâ€™s unspent and I only have the head of the blockchain, then I need to check all the inbetween transactions and check if they spend my transaction or not.</p>
