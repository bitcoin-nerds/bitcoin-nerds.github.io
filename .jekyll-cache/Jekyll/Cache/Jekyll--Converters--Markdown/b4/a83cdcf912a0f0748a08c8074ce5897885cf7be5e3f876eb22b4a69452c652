  <p>Layer 1 governance is not socially scalable unless we either ruthlessly minimize the number of issues it addresses or sacrifice some of the key properties that give a blockchain value. <a href="https://t.co/C1abR6FXwD">https://t.co/C1abR6FXwD</a></p>

  <p>Bitcoin‚Äôs governance matters because Bitcoin is the first successful, most liquid, and most widely known crypto-currency. In the words of Michael Goldstein, ‚ÄúSound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.‚Äù If Bitcoin‚Äôs governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. If Bitcoin‚Äôs governance is flawed, Bitcoin‚Äôs stakeholders should work to fix it.</p>
