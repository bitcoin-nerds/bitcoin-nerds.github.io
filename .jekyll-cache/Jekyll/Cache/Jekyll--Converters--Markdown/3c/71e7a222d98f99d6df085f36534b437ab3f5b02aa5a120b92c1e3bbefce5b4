<p>For me, the most important reason, is its deflationary nature, the fixed nature of its money supply, and that it‚Äôs decentralized nature makes it difficult to changing or tampering with it.</p>

<p>Some other cryptocurrency efforts are interesting to me for other reasons. However, none of them solve this fundamental problem of global currencies.</p>

<h2 id="central-banks-deflate-global-currencies-at-an-alarming-rate">Central Banks Deflate Global Currencies at an Alarming Rate</h2>

<p>In the United States, that began around the time the Federal Reserve was enstated, 1913.  They do this by creating dollars with no underlying value, but are treated the same as all other dollars in circulation. The immediate result is apparent prosperity, as was seen during the roaring ‚Äò20. However, the crash is sure to follow.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a hedge against such practices, since previously, citizens had no other choice but to use their local currency. Outside of the US, many countries made use of even more extreme inflation than in the states. In those cases, global citizens have used US dollars, to opt out of their local failing currencies. However, that is just kicking the can down the road.</p>

<p>Of course, shit rolls down hill, so private banks make use of similar practices, funneling wealth from the bottom to the top.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When this gem first appeared in 1963, it took the form of a small paperback designed for mass distribution.</p>

      <p>Innumerable economists, investors, commentators, and authors have learned from this book through the decades. After fifty years, it remains the best book in print on the topic, a real manifesto of sound money.</p>

      <p>Rothbard boils down the Austrian theory to its essentials. The book also made huge theoretical advances. Rothbard was the first to prove that the government, and only the government, can destroy money on a mass scale, and he showed exactly how they go about this dirty deed. But just as importantly, it is beautifully written. He tells a thrilling story because he loves the subject so much.</p>
