      <p>In the last years, a lot has been written about the ‚Äúhuge waste of energy‚Äù resulting from Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work (PoW). In this series of four posts, we‚Äòre going to challenge this widespread opinion by questioning the main metrics used to highlight the alleged increasing inefficiency of Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW.</p>

      <p>In this first part, we‚Äòll first discuss the main utility of PoW in the Bitcoin protocol. Then, after a reminder of two important properties of Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW, we‚Äôll define a mathematical formalization of this utility (Bitcoin.Days Secured) and we‚Äôll use it to define two new metrics (Unit Cost and Average Cost). At last, we‚Äôll check what these metrics can teach us about the evolution of the efficiency of Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW over time.</p>
